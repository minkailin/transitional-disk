\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:introduction}

Transitional disks are a class of disks that lacks a near infrared
excess, implying absense of optically thick warm dust in the inner
disk. At the same time, these disks show signatures of cold gas in the
outer disk, and 50\% of such disks show signs of accretion (Calvet et
al. 2005, Espaillat et al. 2007, \comm{check, quote relevant works}). 
The age of these disks, in the 1-10 Myr range, suggests that they are undergoing 
the evolutionary stage between gas-rich protoplanetary disks and gas-poor
debris disks. The absense of dust in the inner disk is usually
attributed to the planet formation process, supposed to be completed
or nearly completed in that region. 

Since the early images of transitional disks, a variety of deviations
from axisymmetry have been observed in the outer disk \comm{quote works}. These asymmetries 
have recently been observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array
(ALMA), showing large lopsided dust distributions \comm{quote works}. The explanation in
vogue borrows from the protoplanetary disk literature by suggesting that these asymmetries are the
result of dust trapping in giant anticyclonic vortices. 

Trapping of solids in gas vortices was independently suggested
by Barge \& Sommeria (1995) and Tanga et al. (1996) as a route for
planet formation in the inner regions of circumstellar
disks. Particles trapping in a vortex is analog to the particle drift
that happens in the disk
itself. The gas in the disk rotates at a slight sub-Keplerian rate,
because the pressure, decreasing outwards, opposes gravity,
lowering the amount of angular momentum needed to achieve centrifugal
equilibrium. A particle does not feel the pressure gradient, orbiting at
the Keplerian velocity in the absense of drag forces. The particle
thus travels faster than the gas, feeling a
headwind and sinking. In a vortex, gravity is substituted by the
Coriolis force, leading to a similar result. Particles experience a
drag force, lose angular momentum, and sink toward the vortex
center, where they accumulate. Klahr \& Henning (1997) applied the model 
to turbulent eddies in the solar nebula, finding trapping of mm-sized
particles preferentially \comm{why this wrong result?}, and suggested
this could aid on the formation of chondrules. The dynamics of dust
trapping in vortices was developed by Chavanis (2000), a detailed work 
that set the analytical foundations of the field \comm{model,
  limitations, results?}.  

The first attempt to simulate the process with
fully nonlinear compressible hydrodynamics was carried by Johansen et
al. (2004), imposing a vortex solution into a  shearing box (a Cartesian box sampling a small
patch of the disk, co-rotating with the flow at a fixed distance from
the star, see e.g. Hawley et al. 1995, Umurhan 2010). The model had limitations, chiefly the use of Laplacian
viscosity, that limited the lifetime of the vortex, and the symmetries
imposed by the shearing box, that affected the geometry and evolution
of the vortex.  Both effects combined did not allow the
imposed vortex solution to survive for more than a single orbit, but
nonetheless the vortex ability to trap dust was validated. 

These studies, however, did not consider the question of how to
form disk vortices in first place. Because vortices are exact nonlinear solutions to the equations of
hydrodynamics, these works used analytical vortex solutions, and remained
agnostic with respect to their origin. As it turns out, forming and
sustaining disk vortices proved to be a formidable problem in
itself. Because of the strong stabilizing effect of the Keplerian
shear, formation mechanisms rely on modifications of the shear
profile, in what have been called ``edge modes''. These modes have
first been found by Hohfeld \& Lovelace (1978), and mentioned en
passant by Toomre (1981), both in the context of galactic disks. The first detailed analysis of their
(in)stability properties was provided by Papaloizou \& Pringle (1985) in the
context of ``thick tori'' accretion disks around
black holes, a work that was followed by Hawley et al. (1987), that
simulated the process, and showed that the instability saturates into
vortices. It was the hope back then that this process, that became
known as ``Papaloizou-Pringle instability'', would generate the
long-sough mechanism for accretion, but the fact that it needed a
modification of the shear profile did not play into its favor. 

Though the interest on this process waned rapidly after the re-discovery of the MRI
(Velikhov 1959, Chandrasekhar 1961) by Balbus \& Hawley (1991), and
its rise to paradigmatic status as the main source of angular momentum
transport in accretion disks, it is still valid for forming
vortices. The calculation was brough to the context of cold disks by
Lovelace et al. (1999), who also extended the analysis to
non-barotropic disks, and renamed the process Rossby wave instability
(RWI), due to a similarity between the unstable modes and the
meandering waves in planetary weather. While in the context of thick
tori models the modification of the shear profile may not come about
easily, the situation is different in protoplanetary
disks. Simulations show that two processes naturally form such
profiles. One is the boundary between the MRI-active magnetized zone
and the MRI-dead resistive zone; in the transition, a resistivity
inversion occurs, with matter piling up, generating the favourable
shear profile (Varni\`ere et al. 2006). The accumulation of dust in RWI vortices at dead zone boundaries was
studied at first by Inaba \& Barge (2006), who found that \comm{what
  did they find?}. The other is at the edge of a
gap opened by a planet. That the gap edge is unstable to the RWI is seen in
the inviscid simulations of many codes in the code comparison study of
de Val-Borro et al. (2006). The process was studied in detail by de
Val-Borro et al. (2007). 

These efforts culminated into a coherent picture of vortex-assisted
planet formation in dead zone vortices by Lyra et al. (2008, 2009a) and in 
gap edge vortices by Lyra et al. (2009b). These works solved
selfconsistently for the nonlinear compressible hydrodynamics and the
aerodynamics of interacting solid particles, in inviscid models in the
inertial frame, removing the limitations in Johansen et al. (2004),
albeit in the context of 2D disks. These works inspired a renewed
interest in the RWI, that has been vigorously studied in three
dimensions by Meheut et al. (2010, 2012a, 2012b, 2012c) , Lin \&
Papaloizou (2011),  Lin (2012, 2013ab), and Lyra \& Mac Low (2012)
\comm{tell what these studies found}. 

Part of these results have been translated to the field of
transitional disks. The main difference is that while the focus 
of vortex dust-trapping research in protoplanetary disks is the
concentration of pebbles rocks and boulders in the inner disk to form
planets, in transitional disks the focus is on the trapping of sub-mm
and mm-size dust in the outer disk to match the observed lopsided 
asymmetries. While the motivation and dust sizes are different, the
physics is scale-free and almost identical. The particle size that is
preferentially trapped is set by the friction time, $\tau_{\rm f}$, which is a
function of the gas density and particle radius. A suitable nondimensionalization for the
friction time is the Stokes number, St = $\varOmega \tau_{\rm f}$,
where $\varOmega$ is the Keplerian frequency. While in the dense, fast
rotating, inner regions of T-Tauri disks, the best particle size (St =1, e.g. Youdin 2008)
corresponds to meter-size, in the thin, outer regions of transitional
disks, the size corresponding to St=1 drops by about three orders of
magnitude. The resulting trapping of sub-mm and mm-size dust may not
lead to the critical densities necessary to form planets, but they may
well explain the puzzling observed lopsided asymmetries. 

Reg\'aly et al. (2012) suggested that the sub-mm 
observations of Brown et al. (2009) could be the result of dust
trapping in vortices that, they suggest, could be triggered at dead
zone edges, as in Varni\`ere et al. (2006), Inaba \& Barge (2006), and Lyra et
al. (2008, 2009a). The dead zone mechanism is probably not reasonable,
because the radii is quite far out, and the outer edge of the dead
edge is quite smooth (Dzyuerkevich 2010, Neal 2013). It is probably
not the result of baroclinic instability either, because the outer
disk is isothermal, and the baroclinic instability requires a negative
entropy gradient. This leaves gap-edge RWI as a plausible mechanism. 

If indeed the asymmetries are due to gap edge Rossby vortices, then, 
as the drag force drives dust toward the vortex center, diffusion is
needed to maintain a steady state over the lifetime of the disk \footnote{{This
diffusion is the result of elliptic instability and in general
different than the diffusion in the gas phase (see e.g., Lyra \& Klahr
2011)}}. Steady state solutions should exist in this case and, indeed, Ataiee
et al. (2013), modeling particles of different Stokes numbers, finds
two different dust distributions, as expected. Birnstiel et al. (2013) 
presented an analytical model that yields the dust density
distribution. The solution, however, makes use of the stringent
approximation of canceling the radial pressure gradient, so it applies
only at the radial location of a pressure maximum; it effectively
describes an infinitesimally narrow ring.  In this work we derive the 
steady state distribution of dust trapped in vortices, accurate to first order in
Stokes number, and general in space. In Section 2 we derive the
advective-diffusive equation, and in Sect 3 the appropriate coordinate
transformation. In Sect 4 we solve the equation for the axisymmetric
case, and in Sect 5 we generalize it for non-axisymmetry. Concluding
remarks follow. 

%Due to the drag force, dust trapped in vortices will accumulate in the
%center. Diffusion is needed to maintain a steady state over the
%lifetime of the disk. In here, we seek to obtain steady state solution
%of the diffusion-advection equation of dust in the possible vortices 
%seen in the observations.

\section{Dust steady state} 
\label{sect:model-equations}

Considering the dust is of small sizes, we can treat it as a
fluid. The dust should then follow the continuity equation 

\beq
  \pderiv{\rho_d}{t} = -(\v{v}\cdot\del)\rho_d - \rho_d \Div{\v{v}} + D\Laplace{\rho_d}
\eeq

\noindent where $\rho_d$ is the dust density, $\v{v}$ is the dust
velocity, and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient (the diffusion is due
to elliptical turbulence in the vortex core and in general will be
different than the turbulent viscosity in the disk). 

To derive the velocities, instead of solving the momentum equations
for the dust, we make use of the relative velocity, following Youdin
(2008)  

\beq
\v{v} = \v{u} + \tau  c_s^2 \,  \grad{\ln \rho_g} 
\label{eq:v}
\eeq

\noindent valid for isothermal gas and small values of the friction time $\tau$. The
velocity $\v{u}$ is the velocity of the gas. Inside a vortex, it is
divergenceless and must satisfy 

\beq
  u_x = \varOmega_V y / \chi \qquad  u_y= -\varOmega_V x \chi
\eeq

\noindent for a vortex of aspect ratio $\chi= y/x > 1$. The Kida
solution $\varOmega_V = 3\Omega_K/2(\chi-1)$ smoothly matches 
this velocity field to the Keplerian shear. Taking the divergent of
\eq{eq:v} gives 

\beq
\Div{\v{v}} = \tau c_s^2 \, \Laplace{\, \ln \, \rho_g} 
\label{eq:divv}
\eeq

\noindent and we can find the Laplacian of the pressure via the Euler
equation. At steady state, the force balance yields 

\begin{eqnarray}
c_s^2 \pderiv{\ln \,\rho_g}{x} &=& 3\varOmega^2 x + 2\varOmega u_y -
u_y\pderiv{u_x}{y} \nonumber \\
&=& \left(3\varOmega^2 - 2\Omega\Omega_V \chi + \varOmega_V^2\right) x  = -C_1 x  \\
c_s^2 \pderiv{\ln \,\rho_g}{y} &=& - 2\varOmega u_x -
u_x\pderiv{u_y}{x} \nonumber \\
&=& \left(-2\Omega\Omega_V/\chi + \Omega_V^2\right) y = -C_2 y
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent  so, with $\omega_{_V}=\varOmega_V/\varOmega$

\beqn
\Div{\v{v}} &=& -\tau (C_1+C_2) = - C\\
&=& - \tau\varOmega^2 \left[2\omega_{_V}\left(\frac{\chi^2+1}{\chi}\right) - (2\omega_{_V}^2 + 3) \right]
\eeqn

\noindent Where we define $C$ as positive, so that the divergence is negative (physically meaning that the dust gets trapped). Replacing that in the continuity equation, and setting $\partial_t$ =
0 for steady state, 

\beq
D\Laplace{\rho_d} + C\rho_d -  (\v{u}\cdot\del)\rho_d = 0 
\eeq

\noindent where we set $\v{v}=\v{u}$ in the first term, accurate to
first order since $\tau$ is supposed to be small. Substituting the gas velocity,

\beq
   -\Omega_V y / \chi \partial_x \rho_d +  \Omega_V x \chi \partial_y
  \rho_d + C \rho_d  + D\partial_x^2{\rho_d} + D\partial_y^2{\rho_d} = 0.
\eeq

Dividing by $D$ and substituting $A=\varOmega_V/D$ and $B=C/D$, we
arrive at the modified advection-diffusion equation that should
determine the steady-state distribution of the vortex-trapped dust.

\beq
  \pderivn{\rho_d}{x}{2} + \pderivn{\rho_d}{y}{2} - A  y\chi^{-1} \pderiv{\rho_d}{x} +  A x \chi \pderiv{\rho_d}{y} + B \rho_d   = 0 
\eeq


\section{Change of variable}

We change variables to the coordinate system used in Chang \& Oishi (2010)

\beqn
  x &=& a \cos\phi \\
  y &=& a\chi\sin\phi
\eeqn

The system is not orthogonal, but it has the advantage of matching the
aspect ratio of the ellipses (In contrast, the elliptic coordinate
system, though orthogonal, describes a system of confocal ellipses of
different aspect ratio, that does not coincide with the geometry of
the problem). 

In these coordinates, the transformations are $\partial_\v{a} =
\vt{A} \partial_\v{x}$, and $\partial_\v{x} =
\vt{A}^{-1} \partial_\v{a}$, with $\v{a} = (a,\phi)^T$, and $\v{x} =
(x,y)^T$. That is

\beq
\left[\begin{array}{c}
    \pderiv{f}{a}  \\
    \pderiv{f}{\phi}
  \end{array}\right] = \vt{A} 
  \left[\begin{array}{c}
      \pderiv{f}{x}  \\
      \pderiv{f}{y}
    \end{array}\right] 
\eeq

With 

\beq
\vt{A} = \left[\begin{array}{cc}
\pderiv{x}{a}  & \pderiv{y}{a}  \\
\pderiv{x}{\phi}  & \pderiv{y}{\phi} \\
\end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}{cc}
\cos\phi  & \chi\sin\phi  \\
-a\sin\phi  & a\chi\cos\phi \\
\end{array}\right] 
\eeq

The inverse matrix is 

\beq
\vt{A}^{-1} = \frac{1}{a\chi} \left[\begin{array}{cc}
a\chi\cos\phi  & -\chi\sin\phi  \\
a\sin\phi  & \cos\phi \\
\end{array}\right]  
\eeq

The transformations are therefore

\beqn
\pderiv{}{x} &=& \cos\phi \pderiv{}{a} - \frac{\sin\phi}{a} \pderiv{}{\phi} \\
\pderiv{}{y} &=& \frac{1}{\chi}\left(\sin\phi \pderiv{}{a} + \frac{\cos\phi}{a} \pderiv{}{\phi} \right)
\eeqn

And the second derivatives are 

\beqn
\pderivn{}{x}{2} &=& \left(\cos\phi \pderiv{}{a} - \frac{\sin\phi}{a}
  \pderiv{}{\phi}\right) \left(\cos\phi \pderiv{}{a} -
  \frac{\sin\phi}{a} \pderiv{}{\phi}\right) \nonumber \\ \\
&=& \cos^2\phi\partial^2_a + a^{-2}\sin^2\phi \partial^2_\phi -
a^{-1}\sin 2\phi \partial^2_{a\phi} \nonumber \\
&&+ a^{-2}\sin 2\phi\partial_\phi +
a^{-1}\sin^2\phi \partial_a 
\eeqn

\beqn
\pderivn{}{y}{2} &=& \frac{1}{\chi^2}\left(\sin\phi \pderiv{}{a} +
  \frac{\cos\phi}{a} \pderiv{}{\phi} \right) \left(\sin\phi
  \pderiv{}{a} + \frac{\cos\phi}{a} \pderiv{}{\phi} \right) \nonumber
\\ \\
&=& \frac{1}{\chi^2}\left[ \sin^2\phi \partial^2_a +
  a^{-2}\cos^2\phi \partial^2_\phi + a^{-1}\sin
  2\phi \partial^2_{a\phi}\right. \nonumber \\
&&\left.- a^{-2}\sin 2\phi \partial_\phi +
  a^{-1}\cos^2\phi \partial_a \right] 
\eeqn

The Laplacian is thus 

\beqn
\Laplace{} &= &\frac{1}{2}\left[ \epsm \cos 2\phi + \epsp\right] \partial^2_a  \\
                &+& \frac{1}{2a^2}\left[ \epsp - \epsm \cos 2\phi\right] \partial^2_\phi  \\
                &-& \frac{\sin 2\phi}{a}\epsm \partial^2_{a\phi}  \\
                &+& \frac{1}{2a}\left[ \epsp - \epsm \cos 2\phi\right] \partial_a  \\
                &+& \frac{\sin 2\phi}{a^2} \epsm\partial_\phi
\eeqn

with $\varepsilon_{\pm} = (1 \pm \chi^{-2})$. 

As for the advection term, $\v{v}\cdot\grad$, with $\v{v}$=$\v{u}$=
$\varOmega_V a(\sin\phi,-\chi\cos\phi)$, it conveniently reduces to  $\v{v}\cdot\grad=  -\varOmega_V \partial_\phi $

The dust-trapping equation is therefore 

\beq \label{eq:dust-trapping-uvzero}
\left(\Laplace{} + A\partial_\phi + B\right) \rho_d = 0 
\eeq

\section{Axisymmetric dust distribution}

For an ``axisymmetric'' vortex, we set $\partial_\phi$ = 0, so 

\beq
\left[\frac{1}{2}\left( \epsm \cos 2\phi +\epsp\right) \partial^2_a   + \frac{1}{2a}\left( \epsp - \epsm\cos 2\phi\right) \partial_a  + B\right] \rho_d = 0 
\eeq

We now integrate the coefficients in $\phi$, from 0 to 2$\pi$, to get
rid of the dependencies on trigonometric functions. This yields

\beq
\frac{\epsp}{2}\pderivn{\rho_d}{a}{2} +
\frac{\epsp}{2a}\pderiv{\rho_d}{a} + B \rho_p = 0  
\eeq

That is, 

\beq
y^{\prime\prime} + \frac{1}{a}y^\prime + k^2 y = 0 
\label{eq:axisymmetric}
\eeq where $y(a) = \rho_d$ and $k^2 = 2B/\epsp$.  The general solution of \eq{eq:axisymmetric} is a
sum of Bessel functions: 

\beq
y(a) = c_1 J_0 (ka) + c_2 Y_0(ka) 
\eeq

Since  $Y_0$ diverges at the origin, we can physically discard 
this solution, setting $c_2=0$. So, the axisymmetric mode is

\beq\label{eq:axi}
\rho(a) = c_1 \ J_0 (ka)
\eeq

Or

\beq
\rho(a) = c_1 \ J_0 \left(a\varOmega \ f(\chi) \sqrt{\frac{2\tau}{D}} \right)
\eeq

\noindent with 

\beqn
f^2(\chi) &=& \epsp^{-1} \left[2\omega_{_V}\left(\frac{\chi^2+1}{\chi}\right) - (2\omega_{_V}^2 + 3) \right]\nonumber \\
          &=& 2\omega_{_V}\chi - \epsp^{-1}(2\omega_{_V}^2 + 3)
\eeqn

We can substitute the diffusion coefficient $D=\delta \varOmega H^2$ where 
$\delta$ is a dimensionless coefficient, and ${\rm St} = \tau\varOmega$ for 
the Stokes number, writing thus 

\beq
\rho(a) = c_1 \ J_0 \left(\frac{a}{H} \ f(\chi) \sqrt{\frac{2{\rm St}}{\delta}}\right)
\eeq 

The Bessel function $J_0(x)$ is
non-motononic, with the first root around $x=2.5$. As the density
cannot be negative, that sets the validity of our solution. The
solution is also constrained by our use of the shearing sheet
equations, so the results should not be valid for $x \gg H$. 
 
We plot the function $f(\chi)$ for the Kida and the Goodman
solution, which are defined in the real axis only for $\chi > 2$ ($\psi^2
< 0$ for less than that). The Goodman solition tends to an asymptote
around 0.7. The Kida solution has a  tail around $0.5\pm0.25$ in the
interval of physical relevance. The first zero is therefore around
$a_0 \approx H \sqrt{\delta/{\rm St}}$.  As we made use of the
approximation $\v{v}=\v{u}$, ${\rm St} \ll 1$, and the solution is indeed $a_0 \gg H$, for finite values of $\delta$.

\subsection{Axisymmetric u $\ne$ v }

In deriving eq 10, we assumed $\v{u}=\v{v}$, for practical reasons. We
relax now this approximation, substituting $\v{v}$ for eq 2. The
advection term then becomes 

\beqn
(\v{v}\cdot\del) &=& (\v{u}\cdot\del)  + \tau c_s^2 (\grad\ln \cdot
\del) \nonumber \\
&=& - \varOmega_V \partial_\phi - \tau \left( C_1 x \partial_x + C_2 y
  \partial_y\right) \nonumber \\
&=& - \varOmega_V \partial_\phi - \tau \left( C_1 \cos^2\phi   + C_2
  \sin^2\phi \right) a \ \partial_a \nonumber \\
&&+ \tau \cos\phi\sin\phi  (C_1 - C_2) \partial_\phi
\eeqn

And, for the axisymmetric mode, $\partial_\phi=0$, so

\beq
(\v{v}\cdot\del) = - \tau a \left( C_1 
  \cos^2\phi  + C_2  \sin^2\phi \right) \partial_a
\eeq

Integrating it over $\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} d\phi$, 

\beq
(\v{v}\cdot\del) = - \frac{C a}{2} \pderiv{}{a}
\eeq

And the dust trapping equation becomes 

\beq
\left[\pderivn{}{a}{2} + \left(\frac{1}{a} +
  \frac{k^2a}{2}\right)\pderiv{}{a} + k^2\right]\rho_d = 0 
\eeq

The solution for which is 

\beq
\rho_d(a) = \exp\left(-\frac{k^2a^2}{4}\right)  \left[c_1 + c_2 {\rm
    Ei}\left(\frac{k^2a^2}{4}\right)\right]
\eeq

\noindent where ${\rm Ei}(x)$ is the exponential integral function. 
Since it diverges at the origin, $c_2$ has to be zero, and 

\beq
\rho_d(a) = \rho_{d0} \exp\left(-\frac{a^2}{2H_V^2}\right)
\eeq

with $H_V = \sqrt{2}/k$ for symmetry with the gas sonic scale. We can 
rewrite this length scale recalling that 

\beqn
k^2 = \frac{2C}{\epsp D} = \frac{2{\rm St}}{\delta H^2} f^2(\chi)
\eeqn 

\noindent We can then write 

\beq\label{eq:gen_axi}
\rho_d(a) = \rho_{d0} \exp\left(-\frac{a^2}{2H_a^2}\right)
\eeq
\beq
 H_V = \frac{H}{f(\chi)} \sqrt{\frac{\delta}{\rm St}}
\eeq

\noindent where $\psi(\chi)$ depends on the vortex solution used. We plot 
$\psi(\chi)$ for the Kida and Goodman solutions in \fig{fig:fchi}.


\section{Non-axisymmetric problem}
For the non-axisymmetric problem ($\partial_\phi\neq0$), we first
return to the limit $\tau\to0$ or $\rm{St}\ll 1$ for dust velocity and
formally set $\bm{v}=\bm{u}$ in the advection term 
$\bm{v}\cdot\del$. We are therefore comparing dust advection due to
the background vortex flow and diffusion. 
%This is expected to be valid close to the vortex center
%($a\to0$). Furthermore, Eq. \ref{eq:gen_axi} and
%Eq. \ref{eq:axi} are identical at $O(k^2a^2)$.   

\subsection{Conversion to ordinary differential equations}
The dust density $\rho_d$ is periodic in the $\phi$ co-ordinate. We
therefore seek solutions of the form

\beq\label{eq:series}
\rho_d(a,\phi) = {\rm Re}
\left[\sum_{n=0}^\infty\rho_n(a)\exp{\left(\mathrm{i}n\phi\right)} \right].
\eeq
Henceforth, we will drop the real part notation for convenience. Inserting
\eq{eq:series} into the partial differential equation \eqp{eq:dust-trapping-uvzero},
multiplying by $\exp{(-\mathrm{i}m\phi)}$ and integrating the resulting
expressions over the $\phi$ co-ordinate, we arrive at a set of
ordinary differential equations,

\beqn\label{eq:ode1}
&&0=\epsilon_{-}\left[\frac{1}{4}\rho_{m-2}^{\prime\prime}
-\frac{1}{2a}\left(m-\frac{3}{2}\right)\rho_{m-2}^\prime +
\frac{m(m-2)}{4a^2}\rho_{m-2}\right] \nonumber\\
&&+\frac{\epsilon_+}{2}\left(\rho_m^{\prime\prime}+\frac{1}{a}\rho_m^\prime\right)
-\left(\frac{m^2\epsilon_+}{2a^2}-\mathrm{i}mA-B\right)\rho_m\nonumber\\
&&+\epsilon_{-}\left[\frac{1}{4}\rho_{m+2}^{\prime\prime}
+\frac{1}{2a}\left(m+\frac{3}{2}\right)\rho_{m+2}^\prime +
\frac{m(m+2)}{4a^2}\rho_{m+2} \right]
\eeqn
for each $m$. We only consider even $m$ \comm{why?}. For $m=0$, the $\rho_{m-2}$
terms are absent. We require $\rho_m^\prime(0)=0$ and
$\rho_{m\geq2}(0)=0$ \comm{why?}. 

It will be convenient to write the above equations
in operator form,
\beq\label{eq:ode2}
\tilde{\chi}\mathcal{B}_m\rho_{m-2}(x) + \mathcal{A}_m\rho_m(x) + \tilde{\chi}\mathcal{C}_m\rho_{m+2}(x)=0,
\eeq
where $x\equiv ka$ (not to be confused with the original Cartesian
co-ordinate), $\tilde{\chi}\equiv(\chi^2-1)/[2(\chi^2+1)]$, and 
\beqn\label{eq:ops}
\mathcal{B}_m &\equiv& \frac{d^2}{dx^2} -
\frac{2}{x}\left(m-\frac{3}{2}\right)\frac{d}{dx} + \frac{m(m-2)}{x^2},\\
\mathcal{A}_m &\equiv& \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \frac{1}{x}\frac{d}{dx} +
\left(k_m^2 - \frac{m^2}{x^2}\right),\\
\mathcal{C}_m  &\equiv& \frac{d^2}{dx^2} +
\frac{2}{x}\left(m+\frac{3}{2}\right)\frac{d}{dx} +
\frac{m(m+2)}{x^2}, 
\eeqn
where $k_m^2 \equiv 1+\mathrm{i}mA/B$. We note that
\beqn\label{eq:ops2}
\mathcal{B}_mJ_{m-2}(\mu x) &=& \mu^2J_m(\mu x),\\
\mathcal{A}_mJ_m(\mu x) &=& \left(k_m^2 - \mu^2\right)J_m(\mu x),\\
\mathcal{C}_mJ_{m+2}(\mu x) &= & = \mu^2J_m(\mu x),
\eeqn
where $\mu$ is a constant. 

\subsection{$x\ll 1$}
As $x\to0$, we expect $\rho_0$ to be the dominant term in
\eq{eq:series}, because the non-axisymmetric components vanish
at the origin. Furthermore, we require $|\rho_m|$ to decrease with
respect to $m$ in order to achieve convergence. In this section we
seek the simplest non-axisymmetric solution
\beq
\rho(a,\phi) \simeq \rho_0(a) + \rho_2(a)\exp{\left(2\mathrm{i}\phi\right)}. 
\eeq
Specifically, we write
\beq
\rho_0(x) = D_0J_0(k_0x) + \epsilon(x),  
\eeq
where $\epsilon(x)$ represents the correction to the axisymmetric
solution due to $\rho_2(x)$. $D_0$ is a constant. The ODEs to be
solved are 
\beqn
\mathcal{A}_0\epsilon(x) &=& -\tilde{\chi}\mathcal{C}_0\rho_2(x),\label{eq:m2_eq1}\\
\mathcal{A}_2\rho_2(x) &=& -\tilde{\chi}\left[D_0k_0^2J_2(k_0x) +
  \mathcal{B}_2\epsilon(x)\right].\label{eq:m2_eq2} 
\eeqn

At this stage, we make the \emph{assumption} that the $\epsilon$ term
in \eq{eq:m2_eq2} can be neglected \comm{why?}. Thus $\rho_2$ satisfies
\beq\label{eq:rho2_approx}
\mathcal{A}_2\rho_2(x) \simeq -\tilde{\chi}D_0k_0^2J_2(k_0x).
\eeq
A solution to \eq{eq:rho2_approx} is
\beq\label{eq:rho2_approx_sol}
\rho_2(x)  = -\frac{\tilde{\chi}D_0k_0^2J_2(k_0x)}{k_2^2 - k_0^2}. 
\eeq
The general solution to \eq{eq:rho2_approx} would also include the
complementary function $J_2(k_2x)$. However, $k_2$ is complex and $|k_2|\gg 1$ (because we are considering
$\mathrm{St}\ll1$), so $J_2(k_2x)$
may not be well behaved at boundaries. We have therefore taken the
particular integral to \eq{eq:rho2_approx} as the solution for
$\rho_2$. This is to regard $\rho_0$ as a source term for
$\rho_2$. The regime $|k_2|\gg1$ corresponds to  
$\rho_2$ being a small perturbation to the
axisymmetric solution. 

We can use \eq{eq:rho2_approx_sol} in \eq{eq:m2_eq1} to
calculate the correction term $\epsilon$. The ODE to solve is
\beqn
\mathcal{A}_0\epsilon(x)
&=&\frac{\tilde{\chi}^2D_0k_0^2}{k_2^2-k_0^2}\mathcal{C}_0J_2(k_0x) \nonumber \\ 
&=&\frac{\tilde{\chi}^2D_0k_0^4J_0(k_0x)}{k_2^2-k_0^2}.
\eeqn
The particular integral is 
\beq
\epsilon(x) = \frac{\tilde{\chi}^2D_0k_0^3xJ_1(k_0x)}{2\left(k_2^2 -
  k_0^2\right)}. 
\eeq
Using this expression for $\epsilon(x)$, we can evaluate
$\mathcal{B}_2\epsilon(x)$ in order to assess our assumption that
$\epsilon(x)$ has a negligible contribution to $\rho_2$. We find

\beq
\mathcal{B}_2\epsilon(x) =
-\frac{\tilde{\chi}^2D_0k_0^5xJ_1(k_0x)}{2\left(k_2^2 -
  k_0^2\right)}. 
\eeq

Both the $\tilde{\chi}^2$ term and the $k_2^2$ term contributes to
making $\mathcal{B}_2\epsilon$ small in comparison to the $J_2$ term
on the RHS of \eq{eq:m2_eq2}. 

An iteration scheme can now be set up. One can update
$\rho_2$ with the inclusion of $\mathcal{B}_2\epsilon(x)$ using
\eq{eq:m2_eq2}, then in turn update $\epsilon(x)$ using
\eq{eq:m2_eq1} and so on. 


\subsection{Lower $m$ mode as a source for higher $m$ mode}
Let us assume that for each $m\geq2$, $\rho_{m-2}$ acts as a source
for $\rho_{m}$, and that the effect due to $\rho_{m+2}$ can be
neglected. That is
\beq
\mathcal{A}_m\rho_m(x) = -\tilde{\chi}\mathcal{B}_m\rho_{m-2}. 
\eeq 
Then, by induction,
\beq
\rho_m(x) =D_0
\frac{(-1)^{m/2}\tilde{\chi}^{m/2}k_0^m}{\prod_{l=1}^{m/2}(k_{2l}^2-k_0^2)}J_m(k_0x). 
\eeq
