This paper looks at the steady state dust distribution in disk vortices. Such
vortices are among the preferred candidates to explain the asymmetries newly
detected by ALMA, therefore obtaining an analytical form of the dust distribution is
a timely effort, especially as the authors are proposing a method to compare with
future observations. 

The paper is clearly written and the analytical work is presented with clarity.
Nevertheless, I would like some of the hypotheses/choices made to be clarified.

a) How does the choice of the shearing sheet approximation influence the results? In
this approximation the vortex would not survive for long, as some of the terms
necessary are not kept, those terms could have an influence on the results. The
author could either comment on those terms and try to  assess their influence on the
resulting dust distribution or use the full Rossby-Shearing Sheet approximation. 

b) How are the vortex models the authors are using different from the ones obtained
in, for example, RWI simulations?

c) Is the choice of the diffusion component important? How does it influence the
results?

Concerning the comparison with observation, it would be nice to add the typical
resolution required in order to determine the parameters such as \delta. Indeed,
what is the spatial resolution needed on the rms of the radial velocity  field
inside the vortex? That would probably translate into a minimal distance of the
vortex to be readily seen with ALMA.

Also, what are the typical dust sizes, how well can we resolve the aspect ratio at
that wavelength? how do the error bar/ upper limit on the aspect ratio influence the
comparison with observation? 

On a side note, the author might want to remind the reader a bit more often when the
use of axisymmetric refers to the new coordinate system.
