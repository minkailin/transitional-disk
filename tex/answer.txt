We thank the referee for insightful questions and comments that helped
improve our work. Changes wrt the previous manuscript are marked as
blue font text in this new version. 

In addition to modifications related to the points raised by the referee, we 
highlight that we have taken the analysis beyond that of the
previous manuscript by generalizing the non-axisymmetric
solution (Sect 5). While in the previous manuscript we considered only the u=v
solution, in this version we solve the non-axisymmetric problem for the full dust velocity. 

We have also derived detailed observational predictions, and present a 
comparison of the model with the system of Oph IRS 48, recently imaged
with ALMA. These go into a new Sect 6. 

We believe these changes have enriched the paper. The answers to the
specific points raised by the referee follow below. 

Sincerely,

======================================================

a) How does the choice of the shearing sheet approximation influence the results? In
this approximation the vortex would not survive for long, as some of the terms
necessary are not kept, those terms could have an influence on the results. The
author could either comment on those terms and try to  assess their influence on the
resulting dust distribution or use the full Rossby-Shearing Sheet approximation. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

We thank the referee for this question. Indeed, the vortex solutions
we choose make use of the shearing box equations, and are thus subject 
to the same limitations as that approximation. In 
particular, the shearing box does not have a radial vorticity
gradient, and thus cannot 
excite certain modes of vortex formation, such as the Rossby Wave
Instability (Tagger 2001).  However, vortex
excitation and vortex survival are separate issues. The vortex
velocity field is an exact solution of the Euler equations, and can
decay only due to viscosity or elliptic instability. Baroclinic vortices,
for instance, are excited and survive indeterminately in 3D
hydrodynamical simulations in the shearing box (e.g. Lesur & Papaloizou 2010, Lyra & Klahr
2011). Moreover,  independently of the excitation
mechanism, these solutions are good local descriptions of the perturbed
flow (see answer to the following question). In short, we are agnostic
with respect to the excitation mechanism, but, once excited, the
shearing box solution holds. 

We inserted this discussion in the manuscript. The new version 
also places more words of caution concerning the shearing box approximation. In fig 3, for instance, we
constructed a global view of a Kida vortex, yet the Kida vortex is
essentially rectilinear, and matches to streamlines only in the
shearing box. A very large vortex will be affected by curvature,
which is missing from that approximation (the figure is nevertheless
helpful). 

======================================================

b) How are the vortex models the authors are using different from the ones obtained
in, for example, RWI simulations?

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The GNG solution was used to model vortices found in non-linear
hydrodynamic global simulations of the
Papaloizou-Pringle instability, which is similar to
the RWI. Recent studies (Lin & Papaloizou 2011) also found that, in
quasi-steady state, the RWI vortices excited at planetary gap edges 
resemble vortices formed by perturbing the disk with
the Kida solution. We are thus confident that the chosen vortex models are suitable
as a first model for disk vortices.  In any case, the solutions we
find are easily generalized to any flow in the form (u_x,u_y) \propto (y,-x). 

We also point out now that the vortex velocity field (u_x,u_y) \propto
(y,-x) is unbounded, and eventually goes supersonic at some point. This defines a "sonic
perimeter" beyond which deviations from the vortex motion easily lead
to shocks, which effectively gives rise to a "vortex boundary". We
calculate this boundary to be of semiminor axis ~ H/2 (giving vortices
a radial extent of roughly H), in agreement with numerical
simulations. 

We included this discussion in the manuscript. 

======================================================

c) Is the choice of the diffusion component important? How does it influence the
results?

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Definitely! We were aware that our choice of diffusive flux, 

  J=-D*grad(rhod),  (I) 

was not the same as Dubrulle et al (1995), Johansen & Klahr (2005), and
Birnstiel et al. (2013), who use instead 

J=-D*rhog*grad(rhod/rhog).  (II) 

While (I) equalizes the dust density, (II) equalizes the dust-to-gas
ratio, a desirable property. However, these works simply throw this
diffusive flux without reference or rationale with respect to its
ab initio derivation. That's why we chose (I) in the submitted manuscript. 

However, when attempting to derive observables, we encountered with
the flux given by (I) some puzzling results, such as the vortex scale length Hv propto
delta/St. If that was the case, tracer particles (St=0) would have Hv extending
to infinity. With the flux given by (II), the scale length is Hv
propto (delta/(St+delta)), which, for St=0, has the neat properties of remaining
finite and being unaffected by diffusion. 

We did now a literature search on the origin of the diffusion equation
with flux given by (II), tracing it back to Morfill & Volk (1984) and
Clarke & Pringle (1988), who call it "contaminant equation". 

We redid the analysis with (II) as the diffusive flux. The analytical
method remains the same: the new flux amounts to defining an effective
dust velocity and an effective friction time. The results are modified
by, as already mentioned, changing Hv from Hv propto 1/S to Hv propto
1/(S+1), where S=St/delta.

======================================================

Concerning the comparison with observation, it would be nice to add the typical
resolution required in order to determine the parameters such as \delta. Indeed,
what is the spatial resolution needed on the rms of the radial velocity  field
inside the vortex? That would probably translate into a minimal distance of the
vortex to be readily seen with ALMA.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Actually, when we talked of measuring delta, we were not thinking about resolving
it spatially (the beam will smear the turbulent velocity field inside
the vortex core), but of measuring it spectroscopically. 

However, we checked the numbers now, and it seems that even that would
be fairly difficult. For subsonic turbulence at ~10% of the sound
speed at 200K, the typical velocity signal would be of the order of
0.1 km/s. Only the 2 sigma tail of the distribution would rise above
the noise (ALMA observations report sensitivity of 0.2 km/s), and the
signal would be very weak. 

We now suggest measuring delta indirectly, by measuring S(=St/delta) with the
equations we derive for the density contrast, and disentangle St from
delta by measuring St (which needs gas density and temperatures, plus
particle radius and porosity).

We included this discussion in the manuscript. 

======================================================

Also, what are the typical dust sizes, how well can we resolve the aspect ratio at
that wavelength? how do the error bar/ upper limit on the aspect ratio influence the
comparison with observation? 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

We have added a whole section about comparison with observations (sect
6), where we derive observational predictions - the maximum dust
density, the gas contrast, the dust contrast, and the total trapped
mass. We also test the model against the recent observations of the
Oph IRS 48 system (Sect 6.5). Combining their observationally
determined parameters with our results, we find reasonable numbers.
The dust contrast implies S=4.8. The measures densities,
temperatures, and particle properties yield St=0.25, which translates
into delta=5e-2. This implies turbulent velocities inside the vortex
of the order of 20% of the sound speed. These velocities are somewhat 
on the high side, as the speeds expected for the elliptic instability
range from 5-10% of the sound speed (Lesur & Papaloizou 2010; Lyra &
Klahr 2011), but given the approximations in the analytics and
(chiefly) assumptions and uncertainties in the observationally derived
parameters, the agreement within a factor 2-4 is remarkable.

We derive also the total trapped mass, finding, for the (assumed) gas-to-dust
ratio of 0.01, 1.4 Earth masses. This is within a factor 6 from the
observationally determined value is 9 Earth masses. 

======================================================

On a side note, the author might want to remind the reader a bit more often when the
use of axisymmetric refers to the new coordinate system.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

We now remind the reader of that every time we mention "axisymmetric"
in that sense, except in Sect 5.  In that section, we state in the
opening statement that 

"In this section we consistently refer to
axisymmetric as nu-symmetry in the coordinate system defined by eqs 18
and 19." 

We hope this will avoid any confusion.
